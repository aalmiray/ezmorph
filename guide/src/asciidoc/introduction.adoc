EZMorph is simple java library for transforming an Object to another Object.

EZMorph's key strenghts are:

 * Supports transformations for primitives and Objects
 * Supports transformations for multidimensional arrays
 * Supports transformations with DynaBeans
 * Small memory footprint (~80K)

EZMorph comes with another feature: `ArrayAssertions`. JUnit 3.x does not have an `assertEquals()` method for asserting
array equality, and JUnit 4.x has a limited one (it only supports Object[] not primitive arrays). With ArrayAssertions
is possible to compare a boolean[] with a boolean[] or even a Boolean[], an those arrays can be multidimensional too.

EZMorph began life as the converter package on https://github.com/aalmiray/json-lib[Json-lib, window="_blank"] but seeing
that the features provided were more generic than JSON parsing, it became a project on its own.

|Â Commons-Convert aims to provide a single library dedicated to the task of converting an object of one type to another.
  The first stage will focus on Object to String and String to Object conversions.

| http://morph.sourceforge.net/[Morph, window="_blank"]
| Morph is a Java framework that eases the internal interoperability of an application. As information flows through an
  application, it undergoes multiple transformations. Morph provides a standard way to implement these transformations.

| http://gleamynode.net/dev/lorentz/docs/index.html["Lorentz", window="_blank"]
| Lorentz is a generic object-to-object conversion framework. It provides a simple API to convert a Java objects of one
  type into an object of another type.

| http://projects.spring.io/spring-framework/["Spring Framework", window="_blank"]
| Spring has an excellent support for PropertyEditors, that can also be used to transform Objects to/from Strings.

| http://dozer.sourceforge.net/["Dozer", window="_blank"]
| Dozer is a powerful, yet simple Java Bean to Java Bean mapper that recursively copies data from one object to another.
  Typically, these Java Beans will be of different complex types.
